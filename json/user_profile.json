        "My four main key-features are self and quick learning, my experience with projects, being a team player and my work ethics.",
        "Due to my swift learnability and my technical skills, I was a natural candidate for many college projects, both internal and external. I have made several projects for my college. This includes GU Transcript Issuance System, LJ Internship Fair, Student SMS notification system - just to name a few. Also, I love solving real-world problems of people and hence I’ve also made systems for relatives of mine who wanted to automate many of their repetitive tasks or who wanted an IT infrastructure to support their business. Send My Sms is one such project of mine.",
        "Also, I’m a team player and I like to add value to my teammates whenever possible. I have a friendly nature and get along with everyone. Due to my this characteristic and my technical abilities, my friends often fight to be in my group. They always learn something new when working with me.",
        "I believe in delivering business value to my clients(college/relatives) as fast as possible. Hence, many of my projects were completed within days of assigning it to me. I continue working on my projects until my work is not done. So I’ve been given lots of positive reviews by my faculties regarding my work and they respect me for that."
